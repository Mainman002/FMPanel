# MFPanel (Make_Folders_Panel) [Master Branch]
Is a Godot2/3 Panel Addon designed to speed up folder creation in new projects.

My Youtube video playlist for update changes / how to use MFPanel ->

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCsIblKeD7w&list=PL359DaN9yjMo6fHHnKftKwhpwNoSngZtq

so select a branch and then you should be able to click [ clone or download ] and then click [ download ZIP ]

[ Godot2 version ] -> https://github.com/Mainman002/MFPanel/tree/MFPanel(Godot2)

[ Godot3 version ] -> https://github.com/Mainman002/MFPanel/tree/MFPanel(Godot3)

from there you just extract the assets folder into your godot project and then find your project settings and plugins manager, set MFPanel to Active and it should appear in the top left Godot window

currently I'm setting it up so that you can download it via Godot's asset library under tools / page2 / MFPanel (if I did everything properly you should see preview images and a youtube video link) click install and select what you want to download, then follow the same steps above to activate MFPanel (I might make another youtube video later to show how to use it better)

Thank you for your interest, and good luck on your projects / games!
